## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- **Firebase Account** ([Sign up](https://firebase.google.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fleet-manager.git
   cd fleet-manager
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
   npm install
```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   
   a. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   
   b. Enable Email/Password authentication
   
   c. Create a Firestore database
   
   d. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
   cp .env.example .env
```
   
   e. Add your Firebase credentials to `.env`:
```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

4. **Set up Firestore**
   
   See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on:
   - Creating Firestore collections
   - Adding test users
   - Sample vehicle data
   - Security rules deployment

5. **Start the development server**

## 🔐 Authentication & Roles

### User Roles

1. **DRIVER**
   - View assigned vehicle
   - Start/end trips
   - Request vehicles
   - View trip history

2. **VEHICLE_MASTER**
   - Monitor entire fleet
   - Assign vehicles to drivers
   - Approve/reject requests
   - View all vehicle details

### Test Accounts

## 📊 Data Models

### Vehicle States Flow
```
AVAILABLE → ASSIGNED → IN_TRANSIT → RETURNING → AVAILABLE
```

### Firestore Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `users` | User profiles with roles |
| `vehicles` | Vehicle inventory |
| `trip_history` | Completed trips log |
| `vehicle_requests` | Driver vehicle requests |
| `assignments` | Active assignments |
| `notifications` | User notifications |

See [API_REFERENCE.md](./API_REFERENCE.md) for detailed schemas.

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
```typescript
Primary: #F6D13A (Gold)
Background: #2D2D2D (Dark)
Surface: #383838 (Elevated)
Text: #F5F5F5 (Light)
```

### Status Colors
```typescript
Available: #4CAF50 (Green)
Assigned: #64B5F6 (Blue)
In Transit: #FF9800 (Orange)
Returning: #8A8A8A (Gray)
```

## 🔄 Key Features Explained

### Real-time Updates

All vehicle and assignment data uses Firestore's real-time listeners:
```typescript
// Automatically updates when data changes in Firebase
subscribeToVehicles((vehicles) => {
  setVehicles(vehicles);
});
```

### Timeline View

Visual journey tracking shows:
1. **Start** - Departure from warehouse
2. **Destination** - Delivery location with ETA
3. **Return** - Back to warehouse

### Request/Approval Flow

1. Driver requests vehicle
2. Master receives notification
3. Master approves/rejects
4. If approved, vehicle auto-assigned
5. Driver sees assignment instantly

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login as driver
- [ ] Request vehicle

## 🔒 Security

### Firestore Security Rules

The app includes production-ready security rules:
```javascript
// Example: Drivers can only update their assigned vehicles
allow update: if isDriver() && 
              resource.data.driverId == request.auth.uid;
```

Deploy rules:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No available drivers found"**
- Verify driver `currentVehicleId` is `null` in Firestore
- Check `role` is exactly `"DRIVER"` (case-sensitive)
- Ensure `isActive` is `true`

**"No vehicle assigned"**
- Check vehicle `driverId` matches driver's UID
- Verify vehicle `status` is `"ASSIGNED"`

**Login routes to wrong dashboard**
- Verify Firestore document ID matches Firebase Auth UID
- Check `role` field is correct (`"DRIVER"` vs `"VEHICLE_MASTER"`)

See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) for more troubleshooting tips.
